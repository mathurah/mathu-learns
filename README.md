# Mathu learns ðŸ¤“

Not every day has to be productive, or shipping code. But every day is about learning something new whether it be about technology, life lessons, and the why - why we do the things we do.

## How it was made ðŸ› 
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Using the Airtable API + Create React App, along with lodash to sort and show everything in order

## To dos
No project is ever finished!
- Styling
- Seeing how I can get the browser to parse in-line html (currently I have another column to store + format links) and it doesn't seem to accept the formatting from airtable.
